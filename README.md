# Ceres Imaging Take Home

## Goals
Given a s3 Bucket, the app gives the user the option to
- Get a list of all files available
- Download a specific file (pulling files directly from s3 using the boto3 library)
- For a specific file, show associated metadata
- Download all files in a zip

## Running
- Clone the directory to your local.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python/python3 Home.py` and go to 127.0.0.1:5000[127.0.0.1:5000]
